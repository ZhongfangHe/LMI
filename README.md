# LMI
Replication for the paper "A computationally efficient mixture innovation model for time-varying parameter regressions".

Place all files into a single folder to run the programs.

The file "main_simulate_data.m" simulates data from the DGP studied in the paper.

The file "main_sim_github.m" estimates the MI and LMI models for a simulated data.

The file "main_equity_github.m" estimates the LMI, RMI and DHS models for the equity premium data as well as computing predictive likelihood.

The file "main_inflation_github.m" estimates the LMI, RMI and DHS models for the inflation rate data as well as computing predictive likelihood.

The spreadsheets "SimData_S.xlsx", "SimData_M.xlsx", "SimData_L.xlsx" contain a simulated data under 3 noise levels examined in the paper. More simulations can be generated by running "main_simulate_data.m".

The spreadsheet "Equity_Qtrly_Github.xlsx" contains the equity premium data.

The spreadsheet "Inflation_Qtrly_Github.xlsx" contains the inflation rate data.

Other files are functions and should not be modified.
